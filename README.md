# Starting Fresh in Washington

**Have you ever wondered where the best place to build a new Subway is? No, it’s not underground, but, if you did think that, don’t worry, I can show you the best location.**

I built a model to predict the number of Subway restaurants in a particular Washington state zip code. Using this model I am able to determine the optimal zip code for a new Subway restaurant! The difference between the model’s prediction and the actual number of Subways indicates whether or not to build. Eg: the model predicts four Subways in a zip code, and there is actually only one, then there is a market for three additional Subways. The opposite is also true: If the model predicts one subway and there are actually three, you shouldn’t build there. 

In the future, I hope to find the exact commercial space. I would find which types of businesses neighbor existing restaurants, how far away they are from one another, and the prices of commercial space and put those into my model. I would also like to add more census data to improve my model’s quality.
